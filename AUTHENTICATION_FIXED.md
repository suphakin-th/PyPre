# ✅ Authentication Issue - FIXED!

## Problem Resolved

The authentication system had an issue where plaintext passwords weren't being checked correctly. This has been **completely fixed**!

## What Was Fixed

### The Issue
- The `check_password_hash()` function was being called first
- It returned `False` for plaintext passwords (didn't throw an exception)
- The plaintext check was in the exception handler, so it never ran

### The Solution
Changed the authentication flow to check in this order:
1. **Plaintext match** (for initial admin account)
2. **SHA256 hash** (compatibility with older systems)
3. **Werkzeug PBKDF2** (modern secure hashing)

Plus, automatic password upgrade on successful login!

## ✅ Test Results

```bash
$ python3 test_auth.py

Testing Authentication System
1. Testing admin login with 'admin123'...
   ✅ Success! User: admin, Role: admin

2. Testing with wrong password...
   ✅ Correctly rejected wrong password

3. Password was auto-upgraded...
   ✅ Password is hashed: pbkdf2:sha256:260000...
```

## 🔑 Working Credentials

**Username:** `admin`
**Password:** `admin123`

The password is stored securely after first login!
